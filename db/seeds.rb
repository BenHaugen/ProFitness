                          { name: "Dumbell Fly", instruction:  "Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. ... Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other."},
                          { name: "Incline Press", instruction: "Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width."} ],
              "legs" => [ { name:  "Deadlift", instruction: "Bend at the waist and at the knees equally and at the same time. Grasp the bar fully and securely in an overgrip or an alternate under/over grip about waist width (may be up to six inches wider for comfort). Looking straight ahead, your spine in a powerful flat position (not stooped over or rounded), focus, regulate your breathing, breath in deeply and steadily pull the bar to a full military position. Keep the bar close to the body and exhale as full force is exerted. Pause for a second of contraction and slowly bend your knees and low back as you return to the starting position and repeat."},
                          { name: "Squat", instruction:"Here's a primer on how exactly to do the perfect squat. Stand with your head facing forward and your chest held up and out. Place your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. Extend your hands straight out in front of you to help keep your balance."},
                          { name: "Leg Extension", instruction: "The leg extension is a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs. The exercise is done using a machine called the Leg Extension Machine. There are various manufacturers of these machines and each one is slightly different."} ],
              "arms" => [ { name: "Preacher Curl", instruction:"With the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold the E-Z Curl Bar at shoulder length. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched."},
                          {  name: "Skullcrusher", instruction:"Lie on bench with narrow overhand grip on barbell. Position barbell over shoulders with arms extended. Execution. Lower bar to forehead by bending elbows. Extend arms and repeat."},
                          {  name: "Tricep Extension", instruction:"To begin, stand up with a dumbbell held by both hands. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it."} ],
              "shoulders" => [ { name: "Shoulder Press", instruction:"Position dumbbells to each side of shoulders with elbows below wrists. Press dumbbells upward until arms are extended overhead. Lower to sides of shoulders and repeat."},
                               { name: "Barbell Push-Press", instruction:"Grab a barbell and hold it with a grip that is a little less than shoulder-width apart. Pull the barbell just above shoulders with elbows close to your body. Bend your knees and lower your body in to a half-squat position. Press the weight over your head as you press through the heels to explosively stand up. Pause and slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position."},
                               { name: "Arnold Press", instruction:"This exercise requires a rotational movement throughout the press portion of the lift, which increases shoulder stability and targets the inside shoulder muscles at the bottom of the lift. Grab a set of dumbbells and bring them to shoulder height with arms bent and palms facing the body."} ],
              "back" => [ { name: "Row", instruction:"Grasp a barbell with an overhand grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The bar should be resting on the top of your thighs with your arms extended and a slight bend in your elbows. Your back should also be straight. This will be your starting position. Now exhale and use the sides of your shoulders to lift the bar, raising your elbows up and to the side. Keep the bar close to your body as you raise it. Continue to lift the bar until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion, and should always be higher than your forearms. Remember to keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement. Lower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement."},
                          { name: "Barbell Deadlift", instruction:"Bend at hips and knees, and grab a loaded barbell with an overhand grip about twice as wide as shoulder-width. Without allowing your lower back to round, stand up and thrust your hips forward as you squeeze your glutes. Pause, then lower the bar back to the floor while keeping it as close to your body as possible."},
                          { name: "Wide-Grip Pull-Up", instruction:"The wide-grip pullup is an advanced bodyweight exercise that improves strength in the back, shoulders, and biceps. The wide-grip position emphasizes the back by reducing resistance on the biceps and forearms. Grab a pullup bar with your palms facing away from your body, and your hands shoulder-width apart."} ],
              "core" => [ { name: "Sit Up", instruction:"An exercise in which a person lies flat on the back, lifts the torso to a sitting position, and then lies flat again without changing the position of the legs: formerly done with the legs straight but now usually done with the knees bent."},
                          { name: "Plank", instruction:"Planking (no, not that bizarre craze) is a simple but effective bodyweight exercise. Holding the body (light as a feather) stiff as a board develops strength primarily in the core—the muscles that connect the upper and lower body—as well as the shoulders, arms, and glutes."},
                          { name: "Crunch", instruction:"A crunch begins with lying face up on the floor with knees bent and feet planted on the ground. The movement begins by curling the shoulders towards the pelvis. The hands can be behind or beside the neck or crossed over the chest."} ] }
